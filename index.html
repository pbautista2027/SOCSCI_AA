    <p class="body-heading">Overview</p>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="main-body">Dagupan is famously known to be the “Bangus Capital of the Philippines” because of its geographic location, which serves as both strategic and problematic. Its geographic location and numerous fish ponds, combined with the rainy season, frequently results in flooding which always leads to disruptions in daily activities. For years, this has always been the biggest issue in the community of Dagupan City. In response, the local government, led by Mayor Belen Fernandez, decided to elevate the roads to reduce the possibility of flooding. However, this solution did not help the community, rather it became an issue. The elevated roads made it difficult for businesses and residents to access their properties. This led to even more inconvenience as businesses started to close, families struggled to evacuate quickly in times of emergencies, and important infrastructures such as the hospital became harder to access. Moreover, the construction of the roads has caused traffic which inconvenienced residents even further. This decided solution also did not address the problem as it was only implemented in specific locations. </p>

    <p class="body-heading">Actions of Officials on the issue</p>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="main-body">Dagupan has undertaken several steps to control flooding caused by its geographic location and high/low tides. The city has implemented infrastructure projects, such as elevating roads and repairing damaged pipelines, aside from these they are using sandbags to prevent backflow of flood in. vulnerable areas (Dagupan City Government, 2022; Philippine News Agency, 2023).
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, equipment like mobile pumping stations and vacuums are being used to extract floods effectively. The city coordinates with barangay officials and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to develop plans and strategies for flood prevention and management (Dagupan City Government, 2022; Philippine News Agency, 2023).</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="list1">Flooding
                <ul>
                    <li class="list2">The city's geographic location undeniably makes it prone to flooding. The poor drainage system, often clogged with garbage that obstructs water flow, adds to these natural challenges. This often flooding increases the risk of serious diseases due to stagnant buildup.

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="list1">Economic problems
                <ul>
                    <li class="list2">Frequent flooding can cause the economy of businesses to be forced to close when areas become inaccessible. This can lead to establishments shutting down and people losing their jobs. With less income, the budget for emergency relief during typhoons might also suffer, creating more challenges for the community.

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="list1">Decided Solution
                <ul>
                    <li class="list2">The local government of Dagupan City raised the roads in areas such as Arellano Street near big establishments and the Region 1 Hospital. This caused problems for people as residents’ gates were blocked, businesses lost space for entrances, and some even shut down. The traffic from road construction also made the hospital less accessible, showing that the solution was not well-planned for the community’s long-term needs.</li>
